      "My father has dementia and is bedridden, he lives with me. He has been receiving care from LQS Healthcare Services since February 2023. His carers are so kind and caring towards him, he looks forward to their visits. They undertake his personal care in a very respectful and thoughtful manner and maintain his dignity at all times. They spend time chatting and joking with him, they really lift his mood. There is always good communication between his carers and myself. I feel he is in safe hands when they are with him.",

      "I have found the care help exemplary. I now receive help three times a day. The care is wonderful, always cheerful managing cleaning, cooking and washing as well as taking me out for a walk in the wheelchair. The agency is caring and organises a car to help a carer with travelling between clients. The agency keeps in touch with me with review visits and emails.",
